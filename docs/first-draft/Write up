Objective: Modeling a truss-like structure between 2 planes defined by disjoint set of points. 


Delaunay Triangulation: A Delaunay triangulation for a given set P of discrete points in a plane is a triangulation DT(P) such that no point in P is inside the circumcircle of any triangle in DT(P).

Algorithm to compute the Delaunay triangulation of set P:

For each point in P

Tetrahedralization: For the given sets of planes,
